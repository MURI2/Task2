# LTDE Ecoplate project

**Central questions:**

**1)** Has resource usage changed for each taxa?

  - Chi-square test

**2)** Can the descendants outcompete their ancestors in an environment that mimics their resource preference?

- i.e. a series of competition assays

**3)** Do phylogenetically different bacteria converge to similar phenotypes under severe starvation ?

- Analysis primarily based on PhyloTraits repo

- Testing for phylogenetic signal (Blomberg's K, Pagel's lambda)

**4)** Is there a genetic basis for this pattern?

- i.e. based on the metabolic network of each organismâ€™s genome  and the sequence data from the LTDE, do lines from different taxa have similar mutations?
