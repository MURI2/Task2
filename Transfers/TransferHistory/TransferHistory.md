## How to enter data into the TransferHistory excel sheet

*Note: This is a first draft, will be refined later*

The TransferHistory excel sheet is meant to keep track of transfer error and contamination. The data format will be changed in the future. This is a temporary format so that we have a place to enter information regarding potential issues with the Task2 lines. 

Right now there are three columns: Date, Strain ID, and Steps. 

Date is for the date that you notice an issue. Say you come into the lab on October 12th and the media in one of the lines is translucent. This might indicate that the line was not properally transfered during the last transfer. You should record the label of that line and how many transfers back you have to go to re-start the line. During the week, all two-day transfer lines from the previous two transfers are saved (ex. on October 12th there should be a tray with lines from the 10th and another tray with lines from the 8th). So if you had to go back two days, that's one step. Going back four days is two steps. 

I'll be adding columns to indicate issues with contamination later.
