## Sarah's Staining Protocol

1. Stain cells with SYTOX Green, 1mM final concentration. I used 1 mL samples and added 5 uL to each sample. There is an aliquot of SG in the -20 freezer in an amber tube labeled "SG" on the top. That's what I used. If you want more, you can contact Jim Powers in the microscopy center; he is where I always bought aliquots from. You'll need to dilute his though. I am not sure how much of the SG I have left. 

2. Incubate SG stained cells for 15 minutes at 37 degrees. 

3. Wash SG from cells to prevent over staining. I centrifuged samples at 10000 rpm for 10 minutes, then pipetted the supernatant out so there was only ~500 uL of sample left in the tube. 

4. Stain with CTC. You want a final concentration of 5 mM. I made 10 mM aliquots and added 500 uL to the 500 uL of SG stained cells. This can be optimized though. If your cells are really active, you might not need that much. The shit is expensive though so be mindful of that as well. I think I have 25 mg of the powered stain in the fridge in a bubble wrap bag. You can use water as a solution. 

5. Incubate CTC stained cells for 30 minutes - 1 hour (optimize) at 37 degrees. 

6. Add DAPI stain, 4.5 mM final concentration. You'll need to get more of this/make more of this, but I don't know if we have any more of the DAPI powder left in the lab. 

7. Incubate DAPI cells for 10 minutes at 37 degrees. 

8. filter cells via vacuum filtration onto black polycarbonate filer (0.2 uM)

9. Fix filter to microscope slide using the immersion oil in the live/dead staining kit in the -20 degree freezer.
